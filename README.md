## ‚ú® Features

* Displays current weather conditions for a list of popular US locations.
* Shows Temperature(Celcius/Fahrenheit), General Weather Description, Administrative Area, Time Observed At.
* User-friendly interface to view weather information.
* Error handling for incorrect searchs and when API tokens have run out for the API Key.
* Back-end loading of data on initialization and UI Progress indicator when querying data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries Used

* **Programming Language:** Kotlin
* **Core Android Jetpack:**
    * ViewModel - For managing UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
    * LiveData/Kotlin Flow - For observable data patterns.
* **Networking:**
    * Retrofit - For type-safe HTTP calls to the AccuWeather API.
    * OkHttp - HTTP client.
    * Gson/Moshi - For parsing JSON responses.
* **Asynchronous Programming:**
    * Kotlin Coroutines - For managing background threads and simplifying async code.
* **Dependency Injection (if used):**
    * Hilt - "Manual Dependency Injection".
* **UI:**
    * Jetpack Compose
* **Testing:**
    * JUnit - For unit tests.
    * HiltAndroidTest - For UI tests.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project aims to follow the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern (or specify MVP, MVI, or your custom approach).

* **Model:** Represents the data layer (e.g., data classes for weather info, Repository that fetches data from the AccuWeather API).
* **View:** Represents the UI layer (Activities/Fragments) that observes data from the ViewModel and displays it.
* **ViewModel:** Acts as a bridge between the Model and the View, holding UI-related data and business logic, and surviving configuration changes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/andrev91/AccuWeatherDemo.git](https://github.com/andrev91/AccuWeatherDemo.git)
    cd AccuWeatherDemo
    ```
2.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    * Open Android Studio.
    * Click on "Open an Existing Project".
    * Navigate to the cloned `AccuWeatherDemo` directory and select it.
3.  **API Key:** Follow the instructions in the [API Key Setup](#-api-key-setup) section below.
4.  **Build and Run:**
    * Let Android Studio sync the Gradle files.
    * Build the project (Build > Make Project).
    * Run the app on an emulator or a physical Android device.

## üîë API Key Setup

This project requires an API key from AccuWeather to fetch weather data.

1.  **Get an API Key:**
    * Go to the [AccuWeather Developer Portal](https://developer.accuweather.com/) and register for a free API key.
2.  **Store the API Key:**
    * Create a file named `local.properties` in the root directory of the project (the same level as `gradle.properties` and `settings.gradle`).
    * **Important:** Add `local.properties` to your `.gitignore` file if it's not already there to prevent your key from being committed to Git.
        ```
        # .gitignore
        ...
        local.properties
        ```
    * Add your API key to `local.properties` like this:
        ```properties
        ACCUWEATHER_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_ACCUWEATHER_API_KEY"
        ```
    The project is configured to read this key from `local.properties` via the `build.gradle` file.

## ü§î Project Motivation & Learning

* **Why I built this:** This project was developed as a personal initiative to practice and demonstrate my Android development skills, particularly in areas like API integration, modern Android architecture (MVVM), and asynchronous programming with Kotlin Coroutines.
* **What I learned:** Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with Retrofit for network requests, designing a reactive UI with LiveData/Flow, and structuring an app using the MVVM pattern. I also focused on creating a clean and maintainable codebase.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements (To-Do)

While this demo showcases core functionality, here are some potential future improvements:

* [ ] Implement location search functionality for users to get weather for any city.
* [ ] Use device GPS to fetch weather for the current location (with proper permission handling).
* [ ] Add more detailed weather information (e.g., hourly forecasts, UV index).
* [ ] Improve UI/UX with more polished visuals and animations.
* [ ] Implement a local database (e.g., Room) to cache weather data for offline access or faster loading.
* [ ] Write comprehensive unit and UI tests.
* [ ] Add support for different themes (e.g., dark mode).
